#### **Task 1: Architecture Vulnerabilities in Web Apps**
**Question:**
What architectural weaknesses in web applications can be exploited in a cyber attack? How can these vulnerabilities be mitigated?

**Solution:**
Web applications are often vulnerable to attacks if the architecture isn't properly secured. Common weaknesses include:

- **Input Validation**: Lack of input validation can allow attackers to inject malicious code.

#### **Task 2: Defense Mechanisms in Architecture**
**Question:**
How do defense mechanisms such as WAF (Web Application Firewalls) improve security in web application architecture?

**Solution:**
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) sits between the user and the web server, filtering and monitoring incoming traffic to block malicious requests before they reach the application.

**Defense Mechanism:**
- **WAF**: Prevents common attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by analyzing incoming requests.

**Mitigation:**
- Regularly update the WAF rules to defend against new attack vectors and conduct security testing for vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
- **Direct Attack**: Targets the lower layers of a system such as the web application, OS, or network. Example: Using Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities in a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
  - **Defense**: Ensure regular patching and firewall configurations are up-to-date.

- **Indirect Attack**: Targets vulnerabilities in the software or the human element (e.g., social engineering). Example: A Man-in-the-Middle attack or malware using Metasploit.
  - **Defense**: Secure software development practices and user training to recognize phishing attempts.
